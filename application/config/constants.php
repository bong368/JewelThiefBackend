| File and Directory Modes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| These prefs are used when checking and setting modes when working
| with the file system.  The defaults are fine on servers with proper
| security, but you may wish (or even need) to change the values in
| certain environments (Apache running a separate process for each
| user, PHP under CGI with Apache suEXEC, etc.).  Octal values should
| always be used to set the mode correctly.
